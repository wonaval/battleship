# Project 1 Pitches!!!
You must turn in a pitch that outlines what you'll build for your project 1. 

## You should already...
- Know who your pod leader is for P1
- Have "soft pitched" your idea to your pod leader for feedback
- Have gotten approval on one of your soft pitched ideas

## Your pitch must include:
1. A project repo:
  - Make a brand new repo in your personal github. Clone it to your machine.
  - Make a `README.md` (see below for what it should contain)
1. A readme:
  - The file extension `.md` stands for markdown. Markdown is a set of syntaxes that let you do very basic styling on your file (less sophisticated than html + css). You can find a guide to how to use markdown syntax here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
  - In VScode, you can preview how your markdown will look, which is very handy: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown
  - Your readme should have the following sections (each denoted by a header):
    - Title of the project (biggest header in the document)
    - Overview: a summary of the project, including why you picked the game you picked to build
    - Game rules: explain how the game is played, how the player scores, and how they player can reach the win and lose states.
    - Wireframes: explained below.
    - User stories: a series of statements in the form of "When I {do X}, {Y happens}." These statements should encompass the whole functionality of playing the game.
    - MVP checklist: A list of all the functionalities that will constitute the bare minimum version of your game. Note that this list should be sized so that you can complete it by ~Monday, leaving Tuesday to tackle stretch goals.
    - Stretch goals: A list of awesome bonus goals you will work on after completing your MVP.
1. Wireframes:
  - Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Whatever you use, get a screen cap.
  - Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.
  - Move your image files into the project folder and link them in your README. (You might want to put all your wireframe images into a single folder called images or assets. In that case you'll have to specify the filepath to those images including the containing folder.) Pro tip: use VScode's markdown previewer!


## Turning in your pitch
Commit your `README.md` with these components completed, and push to your project repo. Link your project repo in the google classroom assignment for the P1 Pitch.
