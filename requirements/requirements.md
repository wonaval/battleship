# Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** -- since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

## Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Display a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players, or have the user play the computer \(AI or obstacles\)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS \(Keep It Simple Stupid\)** and **DRY \(Don't Repeat Yourself\)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it\*\*
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS \(adhere to best practices\)

\*\*We will be covering deployment before the end of the project.

## Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

## Evaluation Rubric

When evaluating your projects and giving code reviews, we will use the following rubric for evaluation:

* is your game **playable**? -- *does your game meet the **mvp** requirements*
* is your game **winnable**? -- *does your game have win condition logic that works*
* is the result of the **win condition/score displayed** to the user?
* does your game have a **reset button**? -- *the reset button should return your game to the inital state*
* does your game have **clear instructions on how to play**? -- *a user who has never played your game before needs to be able to understand how to play*
* is your game **well documented** in your `readme.md`?
* did you use a **good git workflow** by commiting your work frequently and at appropriate times during the project?
* is your **js well organized**?
* did you use a good coding style with **DRY principles**?
* is there effort put into **styling your game**?
* **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

| Score | Expectations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0** | _Incomplete._ |
| **1** | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

This total score will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but **the most important feedback is the code review**, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## What Your`Readme.md` Needs To include

Your `readme.md` will be the resource document for your project. It needs to give a **clear overview** of the project from start to finish. 

Before beginning your project, the `readme.md` should describe your vision of the project and your plans on how to achieve your goals. Take a look at `pitch.md` for what your readme needs to contain before you begin work.

After your project is complete, your `readme.me` should get updated. Add the following sections:

* a brief summary of how your game works on a technical level
* the technologies used to create your game
* cool code snippets to illustrate how your game works
* sources used

Also, it's ok if your user stories, wireframes, and mvp definition change a little from the time you pitch your project to the time it's finished. You should update your readme at the end of the project to make sure it's an accurate representation of what you built.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** \(data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation\) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** \(console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc\) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** \(MDN, etc.\) to better understand what you'll be getting into.
* **Don't be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements \(buttons, links, etc\) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you're trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven't solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Getting Started with a Git Repo

* Create a new git repository on Github \(title can be the name of your project\)
* Clone your project onto your computer.
* Start making changes!
